a question and answer function where, on clicking the "+" sign, the div expands to show the answer to that particular question. 

the "+" sign transforms to "-" which on click minimizes or collaps the answer and transforms back to "+" sign. 

functions on the site made it possible to ensure that twi answers cannot be displayed at the same time. if any answer is expanded and the user clicks on a another question, the previously open answer is automatically closed and the newly clicked question's answer is expanded. 
Note: use a working internet connection to allow the icons load.
